# ResNetv2

## Overview

The ResNetv2 model was proposed in [Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027) by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun.

ResNetv2 introduced full pre-activation which gave minimum classification error on CIFAR-10 test set among different activation functions.
The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10 (4.62% error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.*


Tips:

- One can use [`AutoFeatureExtractor`] to prepare images for the model.
